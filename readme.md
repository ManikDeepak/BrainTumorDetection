# Brain Tumor Detection
We build a classifier to detect the brain tumor (if any) from the MRI scan images. By now it is evident that this is a binary classification problem. Examples of such binary classification problems are Spam or Not spam, Credit card fraud
We will be using the following libraries to help us create the classification model:

* Python
* TensorFlow
* Keras
* Numpy
* Scikit-learn
* Matplotlib
* OpenCV

## Steps to Develop the Model Using Machine Learning

Our approach to building the classifier is discussed in the steps:

* Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on brain tumor dataset
* Build a CNN model
* Train and Evaluate our model on the dataset
